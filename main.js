If its vulnerable, it will also attempt to <br>   dump the MySQL usernames and password hashes. <br>  <br>   All MariaDB and MySQL versions up to 5.1.61, 5.2.11, 5.3.5, 5.5.22 are <br>   vulnerable but exploitation depends on whether memcmp() returns an <br>   arbitrary integer outside of -128..127 range. <br>  <br>   "When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA over a password <br>   and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared with the <br>   expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've happened <br>   that the token and the expected value were considered equal, even if <br>   the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case MySQL/MariaDB <br>   would think that the password is correct, even while it is not. <br>   Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of hitting <br>   this bug is about 1/256.  Which means, if one knows a user name to <br>   connect (and "root" almost always exists), she can connect using *any* <br>   password by repeating connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a <br>   fraction of second, so basically account password protection is as <br>   good as nonexistent." <br>  <br>   Original public advisory: <br>   * http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q2/493 <br>   Interesting post about this vuln: <br>   * https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2012/06/11/cve-2012-2122-a-tragically-comedic-security-flaw-in-mysql` },

Every attempt will be made to get a valid list of users and to <br>   verify each username before actually using them. When a username is discovered, besides <br>   being printed, it is also saved in the Nmap registry so other Nmap scripts can use it. That <br>   means that if you're going to run <code>smb-brute.nse</code>, you should run other <code>smb</code> scripts you want. <br>   This checks passwords in a case-insensitive way, determining case after a password is found, <br>   for Windows versions before Vista. <br>  <br>   This script is specifically targeted towards security auditors or penetration testers. <br>   One example of its use, suggested by Brandon Enright, was hooking up <code>smb-brute.nse</code> to the <br>   database of usernames and passwords used by the Conficker worm (the password list can be <br>   found at http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords, among other places. <br>   Then, the network is scanned and all systems that would be infected by Conficker are <br>   discovered. <br>  <br>   From the penetration tester perspective its use is pretty obvious. By discovering weak passwords <br>   on SMB, a protocol that's well suited for bruteforcing, access to a system can be gained. <br>   Further, passwords discovered against Windows with SMB might also be used on Linux or MySQL <br>   or custom Web applications. Discovering a password greatly beneficial for a pen-tester. <br>  <br>   This script uses a lot of little tricks that I (Ron Bowes) describe in detail in a blog <br>   posting, http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p=164. The tricks will be summarized here, but <br>   that blog is the best place to learn more. <br>  <br>   Usernames and passwords are initially taken from the unpwdb library. If possible, the usernames <br>   are verified as existing by taking advantage of Windows' odd behaviour with invalid username <br>   and invalid password responses. As soon as it is able, this script will download a full list <br>   of usernames from the server and replace the unpw usernames with those. This enables the <br>   script to restrict itself to actual accounts only. <br>  <br>   When an account is discovered, it's saved in the <code>smb</code> module (which uses the Nmap <br>   registry). If an account is already saved, the account's privileges are checked; accounts <br>   with administrator privileges are kept over accounts without. The specific method for checking <br>   is by calling <code>GetShareInfo("IPC$")</code>, which requires administrative privileges. Once this script <br>   is finished (all other smb scripts depend on it, it'll run first), other scripts will use the saved account <br>   to perform their checks. <br>  <br>   The blank password is always tried first, followed by "special passwords" (such as the username <br>   and the username reversed). Once those are exhausted, the unpwdb password list is used. <br>  <br>   One major goal of this script is to avoid account lockouts. This is done in a few ways. First, <br>   when a lockout is detected, unless you user specifically overrides it with the <code>smblockout</code> <br>   argument, the scan stops. Second, all usernames are checked with the most common passwords first, <br>   so with not-too-strict lockouts (10 invalid attempts), the 10 most common passwords will still <br>   be tried. Third, one account, called the canary, "goes out ahead"; that is, three invalid <br>   attempts are made (by default) to ensure that it's locked out before others are. <br>  <br>   In addition to active accounts, this script will identify valid passwords for accounts that <br>   are disabled, guest-equivalent, and require password changes. Although these accounts can't <br>   be used, it's good to know that the password is valid. In other cases, it's impossible to <br>   tell a valid password (if an account is locked out, for example). These are displayed, too. <br>   Certain accounts, such as guest or some guest-equivalent, will permit any password. This <br>   is also detected. When possible, the SMB protocol is used to its fullest to get maximum <br>   information. <br>  <br>   When possible, checks are done using a case-insensitive password, then proper case is <br>   determined with a fairly efficient bruteforce. For example, if the actual password is <br>   "PassWord", then "password" will work and "PassWord" will be found afterwards (on the <br>   14th attempt out of a possible 256 attempts, with the current algorithm).` },

The goal of this script <br>   is to discover all user accounts that exist on a remote system. This can be <br>   helpful for administration, by seeing who has an account on a server, or for <br>   penetration testing or network footprinting, by determining which accounts <br>   exist on a system. <br>  <br>   A penetration tester who is examining servers may wish to determine the <br>   purpose of a server. By getting a list of who has access to it, the tester <br>   might get a better idea (if financial people have accounts, it probably <br>   relates to financial information). Additionally, knowing which accounts <br>   exist on a system (or on multiple systems) allows the pen-tester to build a <br>   dictionary of possible usernames for bruteforces, such as a SMB bruteforce <br>   or a Telnet bruteforce. These accounts may be helpful for other purposes, <br>   such as using the accounts in Web applications on this or other servers. <br>  <br>   From a pen-testers perspective, retrieving the list of users on any <br>   given server creates endless possibilities. <br>  <br>   Users are enumerated in two different ways:  using SAMR enumeration or <br>   LSA bruteforcing. By default, both are used, but they have specific <br>   advantages and disadvantages. Using both is a great default, but in certain <br>   circumstances it may be best to give preference to one. <br>  <br>   Advantages of using SAMR enumeration: <br>   * Stealthier (requires one packet/user account, whereas LSA uses at least 10 packets while SAMR uses half that; additionally, LSA makes a lot of noise in the Windows event log (LSA enumeration is the only script I (Ron Bowes) have been called on by the administrator of a box I was testing against). <br>   * More information is returned (more than just the username). <br>   * Every account will be found, since they're being enumerated with a function that's designed to enumerate users. <br>  <br>   Advantages of using LSA bruteforcing: <br>   * More accounts are returned (system accounts, groups, and aliases are returned, not just users). <br>   * Requires a lower-level account to run on Windows XP and higher (a 'guest' account can be used, whereas SAMR enumeration requires a 'user' account; especially useful when only guest access is allowed, or when an account has a blank password (which effectively gives it guest access)). <br>  <br>   SAMR enumeration is done with the  <code>QueryDisplayInfo</code> function. <br>   If this succeeds, it will return a detailed list of users, along with descriptions, <br>   types, and full names. This can be done anonymously against Windows 2000, and <br>   with a user-level account on other Windows versions (but not with a guest-level account). <br>  <br>   To perform this test, the following functions are used: <br>   * <code>Bind</code>: bind to the SAMR service. <br>   * <code>Connect4</code>: get a connect_handle. <br>   * <code>EnumDomains</code>: get a list of the domains. <br>   * <code>QueryDomain</code>: get the sid for the domain. <br>   * <code>OpenDomain</code>: get a handle for each domain. <br>   * <code>QueryDisplayInfo</code>: get the list of users in the domain. <br>   * <code>Close</code>: Close the domain handle. <br>   * <code>Close</code>: Close the connect handle. <br>   The advantage of this technique is that a lot of details are returned, including <br>   the full name and description; the disadvantage is that it requires a user-level <br>   account on every system except for Windows 2000. Additionally, it only pulls actual <br>   user accounts, not groups or aliases. <br>  <br>   Regardless of whether this succeeds, a second technique is used to pull <br>   user accounts, called LSA bruteforcing. LSA bruteforcing can be done anonymously <br>   against Windows 2000, and requires a guest account or better on other systems. <br>   It has the advantage of running with less permission, and will also find more <br>   account types (i.e., groups, aliases, etc.). The disadvantages is that it returns <br>   less information, and that, because it's a brute-force guess, it's possible to miss <br>   accounts. It's also extremely noisy. <br>  <br>   This isn't a brute-force technique in the common sense, however: it's a brute-forcing of users' <br>   RIDs. A user's RID is a value (generally 500, 501, or 1000+) that uniquely identifies <br>   a user on a domain or system. An LSA function is exposed which lets us convert the RID <br>   (say, 1000) to the username (say, "Ron"). So, the technique will essentially try <br>   converting 1000 to a name, then 1001, 1002, etc., until we think we're done. <br>  <br>   To do this, the script breaks users into groups of RIDs based on the <code>LSA_GROUPSIZE</code> <br>   constant. All members of this group are checked simultaneously, and the responses recorded. <br>   When a series of empty groups are found (<code>LSA_MINEMPTY</code> groups, specifically), <br>   the scan ends. As long as you are getting a few groups with active accounts, the scan will <br>   continue. <br>  <br>   Before attempting this conversion, the SID of the server has to be determined. <br>   The SID is determined by doing the reverse operation; that is, by converting a name into <br>   its RID.

It <br>   doesn't hurt to add more. <br>  <br>   The names and details from both of these techniques are merged and displayed. <br>   If the output is verbose, then extra details are shown.

This is great for gathering information about servers, <br>   running the same tool on a range of system, or even installing a backdoor on <br>   a collection of computers. <br>  <br>   This script can run commands present on the remote machine, such as ping or <br>   tracert, or it can upload a program and run it, such as pwdump6 or a <br>   backdoor. Additionally, it can read the program's stdout/stderr and return <br>   it to the user (works well with ping, pwdump6, etc), or it can read a file <br>   that the process generated (fgdump, for example, generates a file), or it <br>   can just start the process and let it run headless (a backdoor might run <br>   like this). <br>  <br>   To use this, a configuration file should be created and edited. Several <br>   configuration files are included that you can customize, or you can write <br>   your own. This config file is placed in <code>nselib/data/psexec</code> (if <br>   you aren't sure where that is, search your system for <br>   <code>default.lua</code>), then is passed to Nmap as a script argument (for <br>   example, myconfig.lua would be passed as <br>   <code>--script-args=config=myconfig</code>. <br>  <br>   The configuration file consists mainly of a module list. Each module is <br>   defined by a lua table, and contains fields for the name of the program, the <br>   executable and arguments for the program, and a score of other options. <br>   Modules also have an 'upload' field, which determines whether or not the <br>   module is to be uploaded. Here is a simple example of how to run <code>net <br>   localgroup administrators</code>, which returns a list of users in the <br>   "administrators" group (take a look at the <code>examples.lua</code> <br>   configuration file for these examples): <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = false <br>     mod.name             = "Example 1: Membership of 'administrators'" <br>     mod.program          = "net.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "localgroup administrators" <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   <code>mod.upload</code> is <code>false</code>, meaning the program should <br>   already be present on the remote system (since 'net.exe' is on every version <br>   of Windows, this should be the case). <code>mod.name</code> defines the name <br>   that the program will have in the output. <code>mod.program</code> and <br>   <code>mod.args</code> obviously define which program is going to be run. The <br>   output for this script is this: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     |  Example 1: Membership of 'administrators' <br>     |  | Alias name     administrators <br>     |  | Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain <br>     |  | <br>     |  | Members <br>     |  | <br>     |  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>     |  | Administrator <br>     |  | ron <br>     |  | test <br>     |  | The command completed successfully. <br>     |  | <br>     |  |_ <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   That works, but it's really ugly. In general, we can use <br>   <code>mod.find</code>, <code>mod.replace</code>, <code>mod.remove</code>, <br>   and <code>mod.noblank</code> to clean up the output. For this example, we're <br>   going to use <code>mod.remove</code> to remove a lot of the useless lines, <br>   and <code>mod.noblank</code> to get rid of the blank lines that we don't <br>   want: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = false <br>     mod.name             = "Example 2: Membership of 'administrators', cleaned" <br>     mod.program          = "net.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "localgroup administrators" <br>     mod.remove           = {"The command completed", "%-%-%-%-%-%-%-%-%-%-%-", "Members", "Alias name", "Comment"} <br>     mod.noblank          = true <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   We can see that the output is now much cleaner: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>   |  Example 2: Membership of 'administrators', cleaned <br>   |  | Administrator <br>   |  | ron <br>   |  |_test <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   For our next command, we're going to run Windows' ipconfig.exe, which <br>   outputs a significant amount of unnecessary information, and what we do want <br>   isn't formatted very nicely. All we want is the IP address and MAC address, <br>   and we get it using <code>mod.find</code> and <code>mod.replace</code>: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = false <br>     mod.name             = "Example 3: IP Address and MAC Address" <br>     mod.program          = "ipconfig.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "/all" <br>     mod.maxtime          = 1 <br>     mod.find             = {"IP Address", "Physical Address", "Ethernet adapter"} <br>     mod.replace          = {{"%. ", ""}, {"-", ":"}, {"Physical Address", "MAC Address"}} <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   This module searches for lines that contain "IP Address", "Physical <br>   Address", or "Ethernet adapter".  In these lines, a ". " is replaced with <br>   nothing, a "-" is replaced with a colon, and the term "Physical Address" is <br>   replaced with "MAC Address" (arguably unnecessary). Run ipconfig /all <br>   yourself to see what we start with, but here's the final output: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>   |  Example 3: IP Address and MAC Address <br>   |  | Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: <br>   |  |    MAC Address: 00:0C:29:12:E6:DB <br>   |  |_   IP Address: 192.168.1.21|  Example 3: IP Address and MAC Address <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   Another interesting part of this script is that variables can be used in any <br>   script fields. There are two types of variables: built-in and user-supplied. <br>   Built-in variables can be anything found in the <code>config</code> table, <br>   most of which are listed below. The more interesting ones are: <br>  <br>   * <code>$lhost</code>: The address of the scanner <br>   * <code>$rhost</code>: The address being scanned <br>   * <code>$path</code>: The path where the scripts are uploaded <br>   * <code>$share</code>: The share where the script was uploaded <br>  <br>   User-supplied arguments are given on the commandline, and can be controlled <br>   by <code>mod.req_args</code> in the configuration file. Arguments are given <br>   by the user in --script-args; for example, to set $host to '1.2.3.4', the <br>   user would pass in --script-args=host=1.2.3.4. To ensure the user passes in <br>   the host variable, <code>mod.req_args</code> would be set to <br>   <code>{'host'}</code>. <br>  <br>   Here is a module that pings the local ip address: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = false <br>     mod.name             = "Example 4: Can the host ping our address?" <br>     mod.program          = "ping.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "$lhost" <br>     mod.remove           = {"statistics", "Packet", "Approximate", "Minimum"} <br>     mod.noblank          = true <br>     mod.env              = "SystemRoot=c:\\WINDOWS" <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   And the output: <br>   <code> <br>   |  Example 4: Can the host ping our address? <br>   |  | Pinging 192.168.1.100 with 32 bytes of data: <br>   |  | Reply from 192.168.1.100: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64 <br>   |  | Reply from 192.168.1.100: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64 <br>   |  | Reply from 192.168.1.100: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64 <br>   |  |_Reply from 192.168.1.100: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64 <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   And this module pings an arbitrary address that the user is expected to <br>   give: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = false <br>     mod.name             = "Example 5: Can the host ping $host?" <br>     mod.program          = "ping.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "$host" <br>     mod.remove           = {"statistics", "Packet", "Approximate", "Minimum"} <br>     mod.noblank          = true <br>     mod.env              = "SystemRoot=c:\\WINDOWS" <br>     mod.req_args         = {'host'} <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   And the output (note that we had to up the timeout so this would complete; <br>   we'll talk about override values later): <br>  <br>   <code> <br>   $ ./nmap -n -d -p445 --script=smb-psexec --script-args=smbuser=test,smbpass=test,config=examples,host=1.2.3.4 192.168.1.21 <br>   [...] <br>   |  Example 5: Can the host ping 1.2.3.4? <br>   |  | Pinging 1.2.3.4 with 32 bytes of data: <br>   |  | Request timed out. <br>   |  | Request timed out. <br>   |  | Request timed out. <br>   |  |_Request timed out. <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   For the final example, we'll use the <code>upload</code> command to upload <br>   <code>fgdump.exe</code>, run it, download its output file, and clean up its <br>   logfile. You'll have to put <code>fgdump.exe</code> in the same folder as <br>   the script for this to work: <br>  <br>   <code> <br>     mod = {} <br>     mod.upload           = true <br>     mod.name             = "Example 6: FgDump" <br>     mod.program          = "fgdump.exe" <br>     mod.args             = "-c -l fgdump.log" <br>     mod.url              = "http://www.foofus.net/fizzgig/fgdump/" <br>     mod.tempfiles        = {"fgdump.log"} <br>     mod.outfile          = "127.0.0.1.pwdump" <br>     table.insert(modules, mod) <br>   </code> <br>  <br>   The <code>-l</code> argument for fgdump supplies the name of the logfile. <br>   That file is listed in the <code>mod.tempfiles</code> field. What, exactly, <br>   does <code>mod.tempfiles</code> do?  It simply gives the service a list of <br>   files to delete while cleaning up. The cleanup process will be discussed <br>   later. <br>  <br>   <code>mod.url</code> is displayed to the user if <code>mod.program</code> <br>   isn't found in <code>nselib/data/psexec/</code>. And finally, <br>   <code>mod.outfile</code> is the file that is downloaded from the system. <br>   This is required because fgdump writes to an output file instead of to <br>   stdout (pwdump6, for example, doesn't require <code>mod.outfile</code>. <br>  <br>   Now that we've seen a few possible combinations of fields, I present a <br>   complete list of all fields available and what each of them do. Many of them <br>   will be familiar, but there are a few that aren't discussed in the examples: <br>  <br>   * <code>upload</code> (boolean) true if it's a local file to upload, false <br>                         if it's already on the host machine. If <br>                         <code>upload</code> is true, <code>program</code> has <br>                         to be in <code>nselib/data/psexec</code>. <br>   * <code>name</code> (string) The name to display above the output. If this <br>                       isn't given, <code>program</code> .. <code>args</code> <br>                       are used. <br>   * <code>program</code> (string) If <code>upload</code> is false, the name <br>                          (fully qualified or relative) of the program on the <br>                          remote system; if <code>upload</code> is true, the <br>                          name of the local file that will be uploaded (stored <br>                          in <code>nselib/data/psexec</code>). <br>   * <code>args</code> (string) Arguments to pass to the process. <br>   * <code>env</code> (string) Environmental variables to pass to the process, <br>                      as name=value pairs, delimited, per Microsoft's spec, by <br>                      NULL characters (<code>string.char(0)</code>). <br>   * <code>maxtime</code> (integer) The approximate amount of time to wait for <br>                          this process to complete. The total timeout for the <br>                          script before it gives up waiting for a response is <br>                          the total of all <code>maxtime</code> fields. <br>   * <code>extrafiles</code> (string[]) Extra file(s) to upload before running <br>                             the program. These will not be renamed (because, <br>                             presumably, if they are then the program won't be <br>                             able to find them), but they will be marked as <br>                             hidden/system/etc. This may cause a race condition <br>                             if multiple people are doing this at once, but <br>                             there isn't much we can do. The files are also <br>                             deleted afterwards as tempfiles would be. The <br>                             files have to be in the same directory as programs <br>                             (<code>nselib/data/psexec</code>), but the program <br>                             doesn't necessarily need to be an uploaded one. <br>   * <code>tempfiles</code> (string[]) A list of temporary files that the <br>                            process is known to create (if the process does <br>                            create files, using this field is recommended <br>                            because it helps avoid making a mess on the remote <br>                            system). <br>   * <code>find</code> (string[]) Only display lines that contain the given <br>                       string(s) (for example, if you're searching for a line <br>                       that contains "IP Address", set this to <code>{'IP <br>                       Address'}</code>. This allows Lua-style patterns, see: <br>                       http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial (don't forget <br>                       to escape special characters with a <code>%</code>). <br>                       Note that this is client-side only; the full output is <br>                       still returned, the rest is removed while displaying. <br>                       The line of output only needs to match one of the <br>                       strings given here. <br>   * <code>remove</code> (string[]) Opposite of <code>find</code>; this removes <br>                         lines containing the given string(s) instead of <br>                         displaying them. Like <code>find</code>, this is <br>                         client-side only and uses Lua-style patterns.

See the <br>                    <code>req_args</code> field above. Script argument values <br>                    take priority over config values. <br>  <br>   In addition to modules, the configuration file can also contain overrides. <br>   Most of these aren't useful, so I'm not going to go into great detail. <br>   Search <code>smb-psexec.nse</code> for any reference to the <br>   <code>config</code> table; any value in the <code>config</code> table can be <br>   overridden with the <code>overrides</code> table in the module. The most <br>   useful value to override is probably <code>timeout</code>. <br>  <br>   Before and after scripts are run, and when there's an error, a cleanup is <br>   performed. in the cleanup, we attempt to stop the remote processes, delete <br>   all programs, output files, temporary files, extra files, etc. A lot of <br>   effort was put into proper cleanup, since making a mess on remote systems is <br>   a bad idea. <br>  <br>  <br>   Now that I've talked at length about how to use this script, I'd like to <br>   spend some time talking about how it works. <br>  <br>   Running a script happens in several stages: <br>  <br>   1. An open fileshare is found that we can write to. Finding an open <br>      fileshare basically consists of enumerating all shares and seeing which <br>      one(s) we have access to. <br>   2. A "service wrapper", and all of the uploadable/extra files, are uploaded. <br>      Before they're uploaded, the name of each file is obfuscated. The <br>      obfuscation completely renames the file, is unique for each source system, <br>      and doesn't change between multiple runs. This obfuscation has the benefit <br>      of preventing filenames from overlapping if multiple people are running this <br>      against the same computer, and also makes it more difficult to determine <br>      their purposes. The reason for keeping them consistent for every run is to <br>      make cleanup possible: a random filename, if the script somehow fails, will <br>      be left on the system. <br>   3. A new service is created and started. The new service has a random name <br>      for the same reason the files do, and points at the 'service wrapper' <br>      program that was uploaded. <br>   4. The service runs the processes. One by one, the processes are run and <br>      their output is captured. The output is obfuscated using a simple (and <br>      highly insecure) xor algorithm, which is designed to prevent casual sniffing <br>      (but won't deter intelligent attackers).  This data is put into a temporary <br>      output file. When all the programs have finished, the file is renamed to the <br>      final output file <br>   5. The output file is downloaded, and the cleanup is performced. The file <br>      being renamed triggers the final stage of the program, where the data is <br>      downloaded and all relevant files are deleted. <br>   6. Output file, now decrypted, is formatted and displayed to the user. <br>  <br>   And that's how it works! <br>  <br>   Please post any questions, or suggestions for better modules, to <br>   dev@nmap.org. <br>  <br>   And, as usual, since this tool can be dangerous and can easily be viewed as <br>   a malicious tool -- use this responsibly, and don't break any laws with it. <br>  <br>   Some ideas for later versions (TODO): <br>  <br>   * Set up a better environment for scripts (<code>PATH</code>, <br>     <code>SystemRoot</code>, etc). Without this, a lot of programs (especially <br>     ones that deal with network traffic) behave oddly. <br>   * Abstract the code required to run remote processes so other scripts can <br>     use it more easily (difficult, but will ultimately be well worth it <br>     later).  (May actually not be possible. There is a lot of overhead and <br>     specialized code in this module. We'll see, though.) <br>   * Let user specify an output file (per-script) so they can, for example, <br>     download binary files (don't think it's worthwhile). <br>   * Consider running the external programs in parallel (not sure if the <br>     benefits outweigh the drawbacks). <br>   * Let the config request the return code from the process instead of the <br>     output (not sure if doing this would be worth the effort). <br>   * Check multiple shares in a single session to save packets (and see where <br>     else we can tighten up the amount of traffic).` },

This is the default setup of pretty much <br>     everything these days. <br>   * Share-level authentication: The anonymous account should be used to log <br>     in, then the password is given (in plaintext) when a share is accessed. <br>     All users who have access to the share use this password. This was the <br>     original way of doing things, but isn't commonly seen, now. If a server <br>     uses share-level security, it is vulnerable to sniffing. <br>   * Challenge/response passwords supported: If enabled, the server can accept <br>     any type of password (plaintext, LM and NTLM, and LMv2 and NTLMv2).  If it <br>     isn't set, the server can only accept plaintext passwords. Most servers <br>     are configured to use challenge/response these days.

If supported and not required, message signing is negotiated <br>     between clients and servers and used if both support and request it. By <br>     default, Windows clients don't sign messages, so if message signing isn't <br>     required by the server, messages probably won't be signed; additionally, <br>     if performing a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker can negotiate no <br>     message signing.

This is useful if you wish to scan a <br>       group of hosts quickly for the vulnerability based on the version number. <br>       However, because of their version number, some patched versions may still <br>       show up as likely vulnerable.

Hence, we check whether this is configured <br>       on the host using smb.share_get_details(host, 'IPC$'). The error <br>       returned would be "NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED" if the workaround is <br>       applied. <br>  <br>   4)  Whether we can invoke the payloads from the shares. <br>       Using payloads from Metasploit, we upload the library files to <br>       the writable share obtained from 2).

When output verbosity is requested on the Nmap command line (<code>-v</code>) extra information about the assignment will <br>   be displayed. <br>  <br>   To determine which of the RIRs to query for a given Target IP Address this script utilises Assignments Data hosted by IANA. <br>   The data is cached locally and then parsed for use as a lookup table.
